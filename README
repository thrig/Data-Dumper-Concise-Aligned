Data::Dumper::Concise::Aligned - like Data::Dumper and cohorts but with
even less indentation for stupidly compact display.

To install this module, use CPAN, for example:

  cpanm Data::Dumper::Concise::Aligned

For the current release, see:

http://github.com/thrig/Data-Dumper-Concise-Aligned

which can be installed by cloning that directory then running `cpanm .`
therein.
